# A Brief Introduction

## About Me
Hello! I am a pediatric critical care fellow, meaning I have completed medical school and a pediatric residency and am a board certified pediatrician, now here at UCSF completing a fellowship in pediatric critical care - hoping to one day be a peds ICU physician and researcher. I have a strong medical background but a very weak statistics/programming background. Prior to summer of this year, the last statistics course I took was in high school and I had never taken any programming courses. Outside of work - I live in the East Bay, have two kids (age 1 and 4) and a dog, love reading, hiking and wine, and I bake fantastic biscuits and muffins! Look forward to learning from you this quarter.

## Why Learn Python?
I am in my third year of fellowship and for the past year have been working on a project analyzing RNA sequencing data from nasal and lung fluid samples of kids with acute lung injury. In order to work on this project I taught myself how to use R and have thus far done all of my coding in R - have never used Python before. R has been awesome, tons of packages and great resources to learn how to use it. But I have heard that Python is the way of the future, so I figured while I am in training it would be good to get some exposure to Python and see if I would want to use that platform instead of or in addition to R. 

## Anything in Particular I Am Hoping to Get Out of the Course?
Of course I am hoping to learn the basics of [Python](https://www.python.org) to see if it is something I want to use in my data analysis. It would also be very helpful to me to have some discussion comparing the utility/functionality of R vs Python, particularly for bioinformatics.
